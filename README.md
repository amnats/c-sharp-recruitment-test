C# software engineer test
==================================

Thank you for taking your time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

* [A coding test](#coding-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

## Coding test

Fork this repository and follow instructions in the project's files. Make a pull request when you're done.
Please check our [guidelines](https://github.com/inframine/c-sharp-style-guide) beforehand.

## Technical questions

All technical terms in the questions (interface, inheritance, etc.) are meant to be conveyed in the C# context. Feel free to answer only some of the questions. Your answer can be of any length.

1. What's the difference between an abstract method and a virtual one? Why would anyone use one and not the other?
2. How would you change the MyList class to improve its efficiency?
3. Name any of your favorite features from the recent updates to the language.
